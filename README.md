Project Name: (Webpages Database Access Records)

Description:

This Python script populates a Django database with sample data for a website that might categorize web pages under various topics. It creates:

- Topics: 

Categories for webpages (e.g., Search, Social, Marketplace, News, Games)
- Webpages:

 Sample webpages with randomly generated URLs, names, and associated topics

- Access Records:
 Simulates user interactions with the webpages (date and user who accessed the webpage)

- Custom Users:
A set of fake users (optional, depending on your Django model setup)


Prerequisites:

- Python 3 (tested with 3. x versions)
- Django framework (installation instructions: [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/install/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/install/))
- `faker` library (`pip install faker`)

Installation:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  # or your preferred virtual environment creation method
   source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Activate on Windows
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt 
   ```
4. Copy your Django project's `settings.py` file to the root of this script's directory (modify `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` accordingly).

Usage:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script's directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python populate.py
   ```
   This will generate and populate the sample data.

Configuration (Optional):

- The script populates `N=5` topics and webpages by default. You can modify the value of `N` in the `populate` function to create a different number of entries.
- To include fake user generation and association with Access Records, uncomment the `create_fake_users` and user-related lines within the `populate` function.

- Consider adding a `requirements.txt` file to list dependencies for easier installation using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Further Customization:

- You can modify the `topics` list to reflect the specific categories relevant to your website.
- The script can be extended to generate more complex data or integrate with your Django models  if needed.

Testing:

- Ensure Django is running with your project's settings.
- Run the script and verify the generated data in your Django admin interface or database.
